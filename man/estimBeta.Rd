\title{Regression slope of recipient on donor values in an epidemic}
\usage{
estimBeta(epidemic = NULL, data = NULL, GEValues, sampledOnly = TRUE,
  activeOnly = FALSE, tMin = 0, tMax = Inf, firstN = Inf, lastN = Inf,
  atInfection = FALSE, report = FALSE, corr = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sampledOnly}{logical, indicating if only sampled individuals should be included in the heritability calculation}

\item{tMin,tMax}{numeric, time interval for which to measure the heritability. if sampledOnly is TRUE this would be
the times of sampling for the individuals; otherwise, this would be the times of infection.}

\item{corr}{logical, should donor-recipient correlation be returned instead of regression slope}
}

Regression slope of recipient on donor values in an epidemic
