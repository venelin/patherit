Description: Methods for estimating the heritability of pathogen traits.
    Currently, this package includes maximum likelihood and bayesian inference
    of the phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mixed model (POUMM) as well as ANOVA
    and donor-recipient regression estimators. In addition, this package provides
    functions to simulate the chain of transmission events emerging during
    an epidemic outbreak together with the within host evolution of several
    quantitative trait loci in the pathgogen genome associated with a pathogen
    trait.
