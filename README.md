Pathogen Trait Heritability

Pathogen traits, such as the virulence of an infection, can vary significantly between patients. A major challenge is to measure the extent to which genetic differences between infecting strains explain the observed variation of the trait. This is quantified by the trait's broad-sense heritability, $H^2$. The patherit R-package allows to compare various estimators of pathogen trait heritability in data simulated using the `toyepidemic` R-package, and in real epidemiological data. 


The following methods are accessible:

1. Direct heritability estimator, $R_{adj}^2$, for data with full genetic and phenotype knowledge.
